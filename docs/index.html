    <h1>AR Tools for Education by Adam Bassbouss</h1>
    <p>This is a playground project to experiment with AR Tools for education purposes. I will keep you updated about next steps. You will be able to use the tools directly on this web page without the need to install any App thanks to Web Frameworks like ar.js, aframe, WebXR and many others. If you have ideas or special wishes you would like to realize please create an issue in this project. Stay tuned!</p>
